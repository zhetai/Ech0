## Quick Deployment

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended)

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name ech0 \
  -p 6277:6277 \
  -p 6278:6278 \
  -v /opt/ech0/data:/app/data \
  -v /opt/ech0/backup:/app/backup \
  -e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos" \
  sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
```

> 💡 After deployment, access `ip:6277` to use  
> 🚷 It is recommended to change `JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos"` to a secure secret  
> 📍 The first registered user will be set as administrator  
> 🎈 Data stored under `/opt/ech0/data`

### 🐋 Docker Compose

1. Create a new directory and place `docker-compose.yml` inside.  
2. Run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Upgrading

## FAQ

1. **What is Ech0?**  
   A lightweight, open-source self-hosted platform for quickly sharing thoughts, writings, and links. All content is locally stored.  

2. **What Ech0 is NOT?**  
   Not a professional note-taking app like Obsidian or Notion; its core function is similar to social feed/microblog.  

3. **Is Ech0 free?**  
   Yes, fully free and open-source under AGPL-3.0, no ads, tracking, subscription, or service dependency.  

4. **How do I back up and restore data?**  
  Since all content is stored in a local SQLite file, you only need to back up the files in the `/opt/ech0/data` directory (or the mapped path you chose during deployment). To restore, simply replace the data files with your backup. You can also use the online data management features in the settings under "Data Management" to quickly create, export, or restore snapshots. If the latest content does not appear after restoring, try manually restarting the Docker container.

5. **Does Ech0 support RSS?**  
   Yes, content updates can be subscribed via RSS.  

6. **Why can't I publish content?**  
   Only administrators can publish. First registered user is admin.  

7. **Why no detailed permission system?**  
   Ech0 emphasizes simplicity: admin vs non-admin only, for smooth experience.  

8. **Why Connect avatars may not show?**  
   Set your instance URL in `System Settings - Service URL` (with `http://` or `https://`).  

9. **What is MetingAPI?**  
   Used to parse music streaming URLs for music cards. If empty, default API provided by Ech0 is used.  

10. **Why not all Connect items show?**  
    Instances that are offline or unreachable are ignored; only valid instances are displayed.  

11. **What content is not recommended?**  
    Avoid publishing dense content mixing text + images + extension cards. Long posts or extension cards alone are okay.  

12. **How to enable comments?**  
    Set up Twikoo backend URL in settings. Only Twikoo is supported.  

13. **How to configure S3?**  
    Fill in endpoint (without http/https) and bucket with public access.

14. **How to join the Fediverse?**  
  You need to bind Ech0 to a domain name and fill in the domain in the server address field in the settings page. Once set, Ech0 will automatically join the Fediverse. Example: `https://memo.vaaat.com`
